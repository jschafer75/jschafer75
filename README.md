# About Me

I'm a 15+ year software engineering veteran. I've had the opportunity to work in a wide array of software development environments:

- Backend engineer working on a partially open source Ruby on Rails devops application at GitLab.
- Full stack engineer working on mulitple internal application at Rackspace, using Ruby on Rails, Golang, Java, Scala, Javascript, and Python.
- Embedded software engineer working with C in a real-time operating system on avionics systems.
- Embedded software engineer working with C on financial security modules.
- Python scripting in multiple areas from code analysis to system mockups.

In my free time, I love coaching youth sports, especially flag football and baseball. I've been working on learning game development in Unity as well.
